There are 3 versions of the script:

1/bruteforce_ssh.py
2/bruteforce_ssh_v2.py
3/bruteforce_ssh_v3.py

- The first allows values to be passed as arguments when launching the script.

- The second allows interaction with the script, and asks us for the ip address, the port, and the paths of the wordlists.

- The third is like the second, but allows you to either enter the paths of the wordlists, or to open a file explorer to choose the wordlists from the file explorer.
